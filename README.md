Welcome to Hogwarts!

Patronum is an website with some Harry Potter information. I'm developing it to train my React abilities.

  * I created the houses' intro page, where you can select some house to read about.
  * I need to fix a problem with the screens resizing (the window is opening always in mobile mode)
  * By this moment, I'm using some libs like Styled Components and React Router DOM.
  * I'm facing some problems with APIs (the Harry Potter API I was about to fetch is off). Maybe I'll have to create and upload my own (and first) API.
